<h1>Sickle-Cell-anemia-detection</h1>
This project aims to detect sickle cell anaemia in blood cell images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Sickle cell anaemia is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by abnormal, sickle-shaped red blood cells. Early detection of this condition is crucial for timely medical intervention and management.

<h2>Dataset</h2>

The dataset used in this project consists of two classes:
    
- Normal Cells: Images of normal red blood cells
- Sickle Cells: Images of sickle-shaped red blood cells indicative of sickle cell anaemia

The dataset comprises 147 images of normal cells and 422 images of sickle cells, totalling 569 images. Each image is of size 256x256 pixels.

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>

The CNN model architecture used for this task is as follows:

- Input Layer: Accepts images of size 256x256 pixels with 3 colour channels
- Convolutional Layers: Three sets of convolutional layers with max-pooling to extract features
- Flatten Layer: Flattens the output for feeding into fully connected layers
- Fully Connected Layers: Two dense layers for classification
- Output Layer: Single neuron output with sigmoid activation for binary classification

<h2>Training</h2>

The dataset was split into training (70%), validation (20%), and test (10%) sets. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with binary cross-entropy loss. Training was conducted for 20 epochs, achieving an accuracy of 78% and a loss of 0.44 on the validation set.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

The trained model was evaluated on a separate test image. The image was preprocessed, resized to 256x256 pixels, and fed into the model for prediction. The model predicted whether the input image represented a sickle cell or a normal cell, achieving an accuracy of [provide accuracy here]% on the test image.

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow IO
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

<h2>Results</h2>

The project achieved 78% accuracy on the test image, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting sickle cell anaemia.
